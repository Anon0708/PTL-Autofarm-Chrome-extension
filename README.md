# PTL-Autofarm-Chrome-extension
Let yourself farm Pushits automatically

First of all, hello user of the PTL-Autofarm Script.
This script is based on javascript injecting

Its a Chrome extension so you need Chrome to use it!
Download the ZIP folder and unpack it.
Place the folder anywhere you want, but it has to stay there!
Go to Chrome extensions and click on "activate developer tools".
After that go to "Load unpacked extensions" and choose the folder you downloaded.
Is that done, you will see a "P" in your extensions area.
Go to PTL.de
It looks like nothing happens, but it normaly does.
To confirm that everything worked out, you have to press F12.
The Developer Console of chrome will pop up.
If the Phrase "Content script loaded and started" appears everything is fine.
There is a random generator invoked, so that the script is not to obvious.
This can take up to 10 mins, so dont worry if in that time nothing happens.
To shut the script down, you need to remove the Plugin.
You are able to normaly navigate through the site, there should be no interruptions.
Bug reports can be made at the GIT-hub comment section.


I wish everyone great fun <3

Just for the Record, i dont have anything against PTL, just wanted to make things more interesting over there ;) 
Much love and Respect for everyone of the PTL community.
That we will last a lot more years together.
